### Extension
This program runs a Conway's Game of Life Simulation based on Start conditions which are specified as command line arguments when calling the program.

 - If only 1 program argument is passed, this argument is assumed to be the grid size or number of rows and number of columns of the cell landscape to be created.
 - If only 2 program arguments are passed however, the first argument is assumed to be the grid size and the second argument is assumed to be the initial status chance of the landscape.
 - Likewise, If 3 program arguments are passed, the first program argument is assumed to be the grid size, the second to be the initial status chance, and the last to be the number of advancements for which to run the simulation of the game.
